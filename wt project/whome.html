         is the primary space 
        agency of India. 
        ISRO is among the largest
         in 
        the world.Over the years, ISRO has also conducted&nbsp; variety of operations for 
            both Indian and foreign clients. ISRO has several field installations as assets, 
            and cooperates with the international community as a part of several bilateral 
            and multilateral agreements. In June 2014, it launched five foreign satellites 
            by the PSLV. There are plans for the development and launch of a satellite which 
            will be collectively used by the eight SAARC nations.
            

The prime objective of Indian space research organisation (ISRO) is to develop space technology and its application to various national tasks. The Indian space programme was driven by the vision of Dr Vikram Sarabhai, considered the father of Indian Space Programme. As he said in 1969: Both China and India are great countries,
“ 	There are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation. To us, there is no ambiguity of purpose. We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the exploration of the Moon or the planets or manned space-flight. But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society. 	”

As the former Indian President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam said:
“ 	Many individuals with myopic vision questioned the relevance of space activities in a newly independent nation, which was finding it difficult to feed its population. Their vision was clear if Indians were to play meaningful role in the community of nations, they must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to their real-life problems. They had no intention of using it as a means of displaying our might. 	”

India's economic progress has made its space programme more visible and active as the country aims for greater self-reliance in space technology. Hennock etc. hold that India also connects space exploration to national prestige, further stating: "This year India has launched 11 satellites, including nine from other countries—and it became the first nation to launch 10 satellites on one rocket. ISRO has successfully put into operation two major satellite systems namely Indian National Satellites (INSAT) for communication services and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites for management of natural resources. ISRO has also developed the PSLV for launching IRS type of satellites and GSLV for launching INSAT type of satellites.
